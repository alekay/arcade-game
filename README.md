# Description
 - This is an Object Oriented JavaScript 'classic arcade game' clone based off of Frogger.
 - Your character's goal is to get accross the field and to the water.
 - The enemies are bugs that will cross the screen at different speeds everytime they respawn in their respective lanes.
 - The goal is to get to the water until the score reaches 5 to win the game.
 - engine.js and resources.js were provided by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) to build off of.
 
## How to play
 - Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move left, right, up, and down.
 - Avoid getting hit by the bugs, getting hit by one will reset your position as well as your score.
 - When you reach the water, you will gain a point and reset at the starting positon
 - When you have accumulated 5 points, you win the game!
